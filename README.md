#STMwavPlayerMR

##Overview
The project of simple .wav player. It plays .wav files from SD card.
##Description
The idea to play .wav files was implement the cyclic list. It contains information about files. You couldn't know the "name" of file, you only need to use 
the button to switch into next music file. We use SPI for sending data from SD card to STM32F4 because SD card module doesn't support SDIO.
